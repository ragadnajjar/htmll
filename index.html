        GHANDI SAID:
        YOUR HEALTH IS YOUR WEALTTH

    <p>
        How can we say that health is wealth?
    </p>
    <p>
Our health is the most important asset we have. If you are poor but healthy, life is still pretty good. If you are a billionaire but in terrible health, youâ€™ve got nothing. I bet any rich person with a terminal illness would go back to zero net worth if they could be healthy again.
